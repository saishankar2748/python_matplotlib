    "## Plots\n",
    "Depending on the objective of your visualisation task, we will choose an appropriate plot\n",
    "-  A <b>bar graph</b> is helpful when you have to visualise a numeric feature (fact) across multiple categories(dimensions).<br>\n",
    "    syntax -- >> plt.bar(x_component, y_component, color = 'orange',edgecolor = 'cyan')\n",
    "-  A <b>Scatterplot</b> , displays the scatter of the data. It can be helpful in checking for any relationship pattern between two quantitative variables and detecting the presence of outliers within them.<br>\n",
    "    -  syntax -->> plt.scatter(x_axis, y_axis, c = color, label = labels)\n",
    "    -  Matplotlib also offers a feature that incorporates a categorical distinction between the points plotted on a scatterplot by colour-coding the points based on the category and distinguish them from each other\n",
    "    -  Another feature of a scatterplot is that the points can be further distinguished over another dimension variable using labels by highlighting the points belonging to a particular element in a array<br> plt.annotate(text =\"\", xy = points_to_annotate_xy)\n",
    "-  A <b>line graph</b> is used to present continuous time-dependent data<br>Syntax -->> plt.plot(x_axis, y_axis)\n",
    "-  A <b>histogram</b> is a frequency chart that records the occurrence of an entry or an element in a data set<br>It is useful when you want to understand the distribution of a given series\n",
    "-  <b>Box plots</b> are effective in summarising the spread of large data into a visual representation. They take the help of percentiles to divide the data range.<br>Syntax -->>  plt.boxplot([list_1, list_2])\n",
    "    -  Box plots divide the data range into three important categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "        -  Median value: This is the value that divides the data range into two halves, that is, the 50th percentile.\n",
    "        -  Interquartile range (IQR): These are data points between the 25th and 75th percentile values.\n",
    "        -  Outliers: These are data points that differ significantly from other observations and lie beyond the whiskers.\n",
    "-  <b>Subplots</b>:Different plots presented in a single plot object are commonly referred to as subplots\n",
    "    -  Syntax -->> fig, ax = plt.subplots(): It initiates a figure which will be used to comprise multiple graphs in a single chart.<br> subplots function returns a tuple so we need to unpack\n",
    "-  A <b>Piechart</b> is like bargrph instead it is useful to compare less than 5 dimensions \n",
    "-  <b>Stackplots</b> are useful when plotting data over certain amount of time and breaking down the total contribution into individual contribution over that course of time"
